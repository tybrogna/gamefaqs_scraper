    Further IO adjustments, mainly cleaning up the weird "check completion" style functions I left lying around
        added append_all_to_pkl()
    Split functions that did two things into their own specific functions. ex: check the progress file, but create it if it isn't there
    Progress file updates when steps complete

    redid file reading and writing to make more sense
        added helper functions, no reading/writing is inline anymore
        moved io functions to a new file, pkl_io.py
    making the Scraping_Step_Struct more of a real object, for extensibility purposes
        gonna have to rename that in the future. pythoners must have some sort of agreed naming standard
    added a test function, will be useful going forward to not have to make web calls all the time to test
    TODO: update get_console_links.py to use pkl_io
