It's time to have a rootin' tootin' good time. YEE HAW pew pew YEE HAW.</p><p>Ahem. Excuse me. I'm just excited.</p><p>Hello and welcome to my <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>
 walkthrough and FAQ here on GameFAQs. This was an absolute massive 
undertaking for me, and I would like to start off by thanking everyone 
for their patience. It took me forever to get this guide in a state that
 I was happy with because of just how massive of a game Red Dead 
Redemption 2 is. You can play this game for hundreds of hours and still 
not find everything. Believe me, I've done it. </p><p>This should 
hopefully be everything you could possibly ever want to know about the 
game. We've got a full, detailed walkthrough of every story mission, 
optional mission, and stranger mission. We've got the location of every 
collectable in the game. We've got details on how to get every gold 
medal, fill up your compendium, and do every single thing in the entire 
game to reach 100%. And then we even have some fun extra stuff too, 
Easter eggs and secrets, that are hidden in this massive world. Ideally,
 this is your one-stop spot for everything <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> related.</p><p>If
 you find this guide useful at all, please consider clicking "YES" on 
the banner you should see above that asks "did you find this guide 
useful?" I would really appreciate it, and I promise to give you some 
cookies. Fake internet cookies, but, like, aren't those the best kind 
anyway. Thank you for stopping by and using my guide. I know there are 
other options for guides, both video and written, so I really want to 
thank you for choosing mine. It means a lot, and I promise I tried my 
absolute best to make sure you made the right decision to stop by here 
on GameFAQs. I HAVE A PLAN, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. We're gonna have fun, 
you and I. So, one more time...YEE HAW.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> is the prequel to the wildly successful Rockstar title <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>. <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>
 was largely the story of John Marston and how he redeemed himself for 
the sins of his past (or how you tied people up and put them on railroad
 tracks - the choice was yours!). <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> 2 is 
largely about all those sins we heard so much about. Here, the Van Der 
Linde gang is very much still in tact. Dutch isn't a raving lunatic yet,
 and while the gang has certainly seen better days when the game opens, 
people are still living and largely happy.</p><p>This isn't really 
John's story though. We instead will be playing as Arthur Morgan, 
"friend" and fellow gang member with John. He's Dutch's right hand man, 
and like Dutch he is struggling to get the gang through their tough 
times. Life as an outlaw is rough, and it isn't clear that any of you 
are going to get out of this gang alive. Well, clearly some of you are, 
if you played the first game. But the Wild West era is ending, and it 
isn't entirely clear what a gang of outlaws are going to do in this new,
 more civilized world. </p><p>Like its predecessor, this is an open 
world game. So, while you'll be leading Arthur around as he struggles 
with the rapidly dissolving Van Der Linde gang, that's only a small 
portion of the fun. You'll meet a large cast of strange characters along
 the way, collect bounties, rob trains, search for dinosaur bones, 
explore five different states, and just sort of wander around and do 
whatever you want. There is a ton here to see and to do, and after you 
complete Chapter 1 you can go basically anywhere right from the very 
start. You can be a saint, saying hello to every single person and 
petting every doggy you see, or you can live a true outlaw life, robbing
 each and every person you come across and leaving their corpse in the 
river. You really aren't limited in what you want to do here, so take 
some time to explore and just have fun.</p><p>This is a complete and 
full walkthrough of the entire game. Meaning, do not skip ahead to later
 chapters or you'll probably wind up spoiling the story for yourself. 
You don't ever have to worry about future spoilers when reading through a
 mission, and I've also tried to cut out the juicer bits of some of the 
missions so you don't accidentally spoil yourself while playing. But you
 will likely wind up running into spoilers if you jump ahead, so I would
 recommend not reading future chapters of the game if you're worried 
about story spoilers. </p>
